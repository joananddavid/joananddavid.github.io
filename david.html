        <h3>FAQ</h3>
        <p><i>How do I RSVP?</i></p>
        <p>We're so excited to welcome you to our celebration! Please use this <a href="https://forms.gle/STd7EnpCbF2Lbh456">form</a> to let us know if you will be attending, and if so, how many are in your party. In the form, youâ€™ll be able to tell us both your preferred meal selection & dietary restrictions, as well as the age of the various members of your party. There will be childrenâ€™s menus for those under twelve.</p>
        <p><i>What does formal dress mean?</i></p>
        <p>If you google it, youâ€™ll get lots of different answers, but from our perspective, formal dress means that you wouldnâ€™t be out of place in a suit & tie or a long dress. However, you could also wear a blazer and some smart slacks, a pantsuit, or a cocktail dress. This is an opportunity for you to feel fancy, but you shouldnâ€™t feel any pressure to go out and buy something for this occasion. After all, cliches are cliches because theyâ€™re true: your presence is the best present! We want you there, comfortable and happyâ€”clothes are secondary!</p>
        <p>However, for the ceremony, there are some slight restrictions! Men and women, please be sure to have your shoulders and back covered while visiting our Lady of Hope. You can do this with a shawl or a jacket, or even a cape! Thank you for respecting the traditions of the church.</p>
        <p><i>What if I feel like dancing?!</i></p>
        <p>Please recommend your favorite tunes for our DJ! Use the following form to let us know what youâ€™d like to add, or vote for options you think are particularly good. We canâ€™t wait to boogie down with you!! ðŸŽ¶</p>

        <h3>Accommodation & Travel</h3>
        <p><u>Accommodation</u></p>
        <p>There are rooms available at the Lansdowne Resort if you would like to stay directly at the venue. They can be booked <a href="https://be.synxis.com/?_gl=1*rnp3n5*_ga*ODYzMjA5NDYwLjE2NjgwNDc5MjA.*_ga_TRD9SBJQX4*MTY3NDQ5MDk2NC41LjAuMTY3NDQ5MDk2NC42MC4wLjA.&adult=2&arrive=2023-05-13&chain=24627&child=0&currency=USD&depart=2023-05-14&hotel=56429&level=hotel&locale=en-US&rooms=1">here</a>, or using any online booking website. The sooner you book these, the more affordable theyâ€™ll be.</p>
        <p>Weâ€™ve also arranged for a block of rooms at a slight discount at two different nearby hotels, each a ten minute drive from the resort.</p>
        <p>We have twenty rooms reserved at the Marriott Residence Inn, Dulles Airport (<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/42.3935642,-71.1329683/Marriott+Residence+Inn,+Dulles+Airport/@40.5945321,-78.7773965,6z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m9!4m8!1m1!4e1!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b638e34cdaaabd:0xf90950b14720d66!2m2!1d-77.4357946!2d39.0079486">directions</a>). Each studio suite is $182 plus tax. To book, call Marriott Reservations at 1-800-331-3131 or 703-421-2000 on or before Friday, April 14, 2023. Identify yourself as part of the Oâ€™Bryan-Atkinson Wedding Room Block group to be sure of the discount.</p>
        <p>We have twenty-five rooms reserved at the Hyatt Place Sterling Dulles (<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/42.3935642,-71.132886/hyatt+place+sterling+dulles/@40.56791,-78.7346331,6z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m9!4m8!1m1!4e1!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b639960ce3492f:0x5d73d0549f4174ee!2m2!1d-77.4069455!2d39.0315986">directions</a>). You can choose between a king and a double bed, each at $115 for singles and $149 for doubles, with $10 for each additional occupant, plus tax. To book, use our reservation code <tt>G-OBAT</tt> <a href="https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/virginia/hyatt-place-sterling-dulles-airport-north/iadzn?corp_id=G-OBAT">online</a> or when calling Hyatt reservations at 1-888-492-8847, on or before Saturday, April 8, 2023.</p>
        <p><u>Travel</u></p>
        <p>The nearest airport is Dulles International Airport, which is approximately a 15 minute ride from a resort. It should be easy to get a ride-share or cab from the airport. If flying into Reagan National Airport, take the metro to Ashburn station, from which it is approximately a 20 minute drive to the resort.</p>
        <p>We've booked a charter bus to take guests from the church to the reception (approximately a 15-minute drive). For those of you without transportation, the bus will also come to the three wedding hotels (the Landsdowne, Marriott, and Hyatt) and bring guests to the church before the ceremony. If you'd like to take advantage of this option pleaseÂ <a href="mailto:jeobryan@stanford.edu">reach out to Joan</a> to let her know.</p>
        <p>After the wedding, D.C. is easily accessible via public transportation, but if, for some reason, you want to explore more of Northern Virginia, we recommend you rent a car.</p>

        <h3>Gifts</h3>
        <p>Presents are not required nor expected (really!), and we have no registry, but if you would like to give us a gift, donating in our name to any of the following charities would be a wonderful gesture:</p>
